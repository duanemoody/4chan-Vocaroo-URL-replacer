Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is 4chan Vocaroo URL replacer, a userscript for Firefox, Chrome and Opera.
It converts text or a link such as http://vocaroo.com/?media=vT1plxX90UX55rEGT
into an embedded object for easy playback.

Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

This script must be run before 4chan X if you want post link previews to work.
If it is not, posts with Vocaroo links in them will no longer have quote 
previews available when hovering over interthread links.
