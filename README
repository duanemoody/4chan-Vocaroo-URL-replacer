Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is 4chan Vocaroo URL replacer, a userscript for Firefox, Chrome and Opera.
It converts text or a link such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJUDx7iEJw
into an embedded object for easy playback.

Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

This script must be run before 4chan X if you want post link previews to work.
If it is not, posts with Vocaroo links in them will no longer have quote 
previews available when hovering over interthread links.
